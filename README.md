# Tracker

Simple tool for tracking combat rounds in tabletop roleplaying games(mostly D&D). 
But there is nothing stopping you from using it in other systems.

For right now it's pretty barebones.

### Functions

- Adding characters with basics stats like Initiative(INI), Health Points(HP).
- Every character have state that can be selected: ALIVE, STUNNED, DEAD.
- Saving and loading from JSON file in case you end session while in combat.
- Clearing whole list with one button if you don't need it anymore.
